Browser-based tool that grabs repost links from your profile, puts them into a json where you can upload them to your website and create a custom repost embed.

- Uses console script to scrape reposts.
- JavaScript loader to embed those links.
- Clean reposts.json format.
- Can use browser extension (WIP).

Tried making automatic grabber but CAPTCHA exists, so this will suffice.
